Recently, I had the good fortune of having research Timmons Roberts and I are working on working on covered in [The Guardian](https://amp.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/21/climate-tweets-twitter-bots-analysis?CMP=share_btn_tw&__twitter_impression=true). Oliver Millman wrote the piece and did a fantastic job. 

It was really exciting to see our work get such wide coverage! It was picked up by many news organizations including

- [The BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51595285)
- [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/02/21/quarter-tweets-climate-change-written-twitter-bots-says-study/)
- [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2020/02/22/study-suggests-twitter-bots-have-substantial-impact-on-spreading-climate-misinformation_partner/)
- [Grist](https://grist.org/climate/a-quarter-of-all-tweets-about-climate-change-are-produced-by-bots/)
- [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2020/02/if-you-see-a-tweet-about-the-climate-crisis-theres-a-1-in-4-chance-its-a-bot)

We even got some lovely coverage by denialist news organizations who shall not be named. My favorite insinuated that I had personally programmed all the bots and then "detected" them in order to smear the very reasonable denialist users on twitter.

If you would like to read the draft, head on over to the [SocArxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/) where you can find a preprint (Check it out [HERE](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h6ktm/)). If you are a sociologist and haven't heard about SocArxiv, I would highly recommend you check it out. It was very easy to submit a paper. It also made responding to email inquiries much easier because I could just send a link with the paper.

If you are interested in similar work, Timmons is the leader of the [Climate Development Lab (CDL)](http://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/) at Brown University. His lab has been involved in a range of projects on climate denial in the United States.

We have submitted the draft as a conference paper to the American Sociological Association annual meeting. It is not looking likely we will get to present it there, but I do welcome all feedback if you'd like to contact me. We are preparing the manuscript for submission right now, and we have some other projects in the works so stay tuned!
