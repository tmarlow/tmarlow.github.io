Hello! I am a PhD student in sociology at Brown University. My primary areas of interest are environmental and urban sociology. My research focuses on the changing distribution of industrial manufacturing hazards in urban spaces. I'm especially interested in developing new methodologies to characterize the relationship between industrial geography and population demographics. I work primarily in R but also dabble in Python.  I'm the Senior Graduate Fellow of the [Brown S4 program](https://www.brown.edu/academics/spatial-structures-in-social-sciences/ "S4 Homepage"), a fellow at the [Institute at Brown for Environment and Society](https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/ "IBES Homepage"), and a trainee of the [Brown Superfund Research Program](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/superfund/ "Brown SRP Homepage").

The code for this website along with other applications are available at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/tmarlow).

The TM logo was designed by my fantastically talented partner. If you happen to live in Bahrain and like baked goods, do yourself a favor and check out her bakery [Alabaster & Cannoli](https://www.alabasterandcannoli.com/). Otherwise, feast your eyes on some of the most beautiful cake photography on instagram at their account [@alabaster.cannoli](https://www.instagram.com/alabaster.cannoli/).
